Live: https://nattseg.github.io/orthobible/

A simple, offline Scripture reader. LXX2012 Septuagint Old Testament with the World English Bible New Testament, original study notes, bookmarks, highlights, comments, and passages for everyday life.

- **Read:** choose any book and chapter from a vertical chapter list; tap a verse number to save or annotate it.
- **Search:** enter a reference such as John 3:16 or a phrase such as “love one another.”
- **Wisdom:** browse passages by topic.
- **Prayers:** a simple prayer book with eight prayers and Psalm text, available offline.
- **Personal study notes:** import your `orthobible-study-notes.json` in Reading settings to store your notes and introductions on this device for offline use. New Testament notes link from verses. Original Old Testament notes remain accessible below chapters in a reference browser; their alignment with LXX2012 is explicitly unverified.
- **OSB reading context:** the updated personal import adds the complete introductions to all 76 OSB books and ten guides, including How to Read the Bible, the book overview, glossary, and lectionary. Open a book’s introduction above its verses, or browse Reading settings → OSB guides & book introductions. The five separately displayed additions use their parent book’s introduction; 4 Maccabees has no OSB introduction. The guides retain the source edition’s references and ebook navigation instructions.
- **Saved:** filter your bookmarks, highlights, and comments.
- **Go back:** drag right from a prayer, Wisdom topic, reading guide, book picker, or linked passage. The current view slides with your finger and reveals its parent. Release beyond roughly one third of the view to go back; a short drag, reversal, or touch cancellation restores the current view.
- **Reading settings:** change text size, light/dark appearance, introductions, and notes.
- **Device persistence:** reading position, saves, history, plan progress, and preferences are mirrored into IndexedDB. Startup recovers the newer copy from localStorage or IndexedDB. Imported OSB material stays in IndexedDB across app-cache updates.
- **Storage & backup:** check offline readiness, request browser storage protection, repair missing offline files, and export a complete JSON backup to Files or iCloud Drive. Restore previews the contents and keeps an undo copy; reader state and personal imports commit together.
- **Reading tools:** recent passages, three reading plans with saved completion, focus mode, font selection, line spacing, and page tone. Search can be restricted to a testament, book, study notes, or guides. Notes and related passages open in previews. Returning from a note or guide restores its search or source-note list, including filters and scroll position. Reading-plan changes retain Reading settings as their back destination.

Footer buttons always open their section’s main view. Preferences, saved verses, and imported study notes remain in this browser. Existing `obible3` data is preserved across the redesign. Calendar and Hours sections have been removed.

The Bible text is LXX2012 + WEB NT, not the printed Orthodox Study Bible’s SAAS/NKJV translation. Built-in introductions and verse notes are original; users can import notes from their own copy without uploading them to this repository.

No account or backend is required. Cloud sync is disabled by default and its settings are hidden until configured. Optional backend code is documented in `cloud/README.md`. Device storage is not a substitute for a backup outside the browser: clearing site data or losing the phone can remove both local copies.

## Local preview

Run `python3 -m http.server 8080` in this directory, then open http://localhost:8080. No build step or external dependencies are required. Use an HTTP server rather than opening index.html as a file.

See `GITHUB.md` for GitHub Pages and offline installation. Run regression checks with `node --test tests/*.test.cjs`.

## Text and numbering

- Old Testament: [LXX2012](https://ebible.org/eng-lxx2012/), Brenton’s Greek Septuagint translation with language updates by Michael Paul Johnson; public domain.
- New Testament: existing World English Bible text, unchanged; public domain.
- All 28,326 source verse records are preserved, including the source’s combined verse labels and omissions. No missing LXX verses are filled from WEB. Psalm 151 is a separate reader entry. Daniel’s additions and the Letter of Jeremiah retain their separate source books. The earlier Hebrew Esther duplicate and 2 Esdras are no longer in the main reader.
- Psalm numbering follows LXX2012. Wisdom references and the Psalm 50 (51) prayer were updated. A Proverbs 22:6 Wisdom reference was removed because that verse is absent from this edition.
- Existing OT bookmarks, highlights, and comments are preserved under Saved → Saved before the Septuagint update, with their original WEB wording and references. NT saves remain attached. `legacy-web-data.js` is retained solely for this offline migration and reference archive.
- Imported OSB notes are not assumed to share LXX2012 verse numbering. All original note keys and text remain available through the notes browser below OT chapters. They are not pinned to unverified LXX verses.

Rebuild with `python3 scripts/build_septuagint.py /path/to/eng-lxx2012_vpl.zip`. The source URL, SHA-256, and counts are recorded in `data/lxx2012-source.json`. The script takes the unchanged WEB NT and migration archive from commit `b42fa0d`.

To rebuild a private context import from the owner’s extracted MOBI HTML, run `python3 scripts/build_personal_context.py /path/to/book.html /path/to/orthobible-study-notes.json /path/outside/repo/orthobible-osb-context.json` (requires BeautifulSoup). The resulting JSON includes the existing notes unchanged and stays outside the published repository. Import it on each reading device; IndexedDB persists it independently of app cache updates. Older notes-only imports remain supported.

For source-linked notes, run `python3 scripts/align_personal_notes.py /path/to/book.html /path/to/orthobible-osb-context.json /path/outside/repo/orthobible-osb-complete.json`. This preserves the earlier notes and adds source verse text, conservative text matches, and review candidates. Only close, distinctive matches are attached automatically; unmatched notes remain browsable and can be linked after comparing both verses in the app. Text matching is not a scholarly verification of every verse. Output and the alignment review report contain private copyrighted material and must stay outside this repository.
